# CPR Events for Midi Workflows

This page provides information on the sequence of events triggered for MidiQOL workflows. Each event will fetch and run associated embedded macros from items, active effects, templates or regions. Events use the following prefixes to identify the context of their trigger:

- `target` includes events triggered for the target(s) of the item
- `scene` includes events triggered for all tokens on the scene, useful for third party reactions
- *No Prefix* - events triggered for the actor rolling the item

These other categories may have their events triggered at several points within a workflow if the conditions are met:

- `D20` events are triggered when any d20 is rolled by an actor for any reason
  - Using dice commands in chat without a token selected would not trigger these events
  - D20 rolls in scripts will trigger these events only if an actor uuid is provided: `new Roll('1d20', {actorUuid: "uuid here"}).evaluate()`
- `Bonus` events are triggered for any save, check, skill, or tool roll

There are many more events available beyond the ones shown here. A full list including descriptions and requirements is available in the [CPR Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1089258451949064296/1280057767947665440).

> *In MidiQOL versions 13.0.23+, saves can be rolled before damage with this setting enabled: `MidiQOL > Workflow Settings > Misc > Roll saves before damage`. This flowchart documents the default setting, damage rolled before saves.*

## Priority

Embedded macros are generally called in ascending priority order for each event. Macros associated with the "Apply Damage" events are the only exception: `applyDamage`, `targetApplyDamage`, and `sceneApplyDamage`. These are lumped together before being sorted by priority, so the order of `Use` -> `Target` -> `Scene` will vary depending on how your macros are configured. The "Apply Damage" events are represented with one node in the chart.
