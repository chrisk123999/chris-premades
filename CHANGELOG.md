# 1.2.0 Release:
## Update Notes:
- This version of CPR requires the D&D 4.3.1 system!
- The following update notes only apply to those who haven't been using the beta version of CPR.
- CPR has been updated to make use of activities whenever possible, in many cases obsoleting the need for synthetic item uses. This allows many automations to be more easily modified and homebrewed.
- Temporarily available features (such as the "Move" functionality of the Dawn spell) are configured as activities on the parent item when possible. These will be dynamically unhidden when necessary (and added to "favorites" while unhidden).
- Items which were previously used entirely synthetically (like Scorching Ray's "Bolt" spell feature) are now also configured as activities on the parent item. These will always remain hidden.
- Hidden activities will be visible on the item sheet. This means they can be _modified_ if desired (for example, changing the formula or damage type for Magic Missile bolts). This also means however that if they are _deleted_ from the sheet, automations which expect them to exist will fail. Unless you know what you're doing, never _delete_ any activities from a medkitted item.
- All 2024 weapon masteries are automated. Make sure your actors and weapons have their mastery selections set, and that you enable the Weapon Masteries setting in CPR.
- CPR automations will exclusively check the item's rules version (set in the item's "Configure Source" menu) before applying automations via the medkit. If an item is set to the modern rules but only has a legacy automation, it will not be detected or applied!
- All previously automated legacy items have been updated. If you've previously modified any macros, you'll likely need to update them.
- Automation of modern (2024) content is a work in progress. Please refer to Pulse bot on the CPR or Midi-Qol Discord server to lookup available automations.
- Modern class feature automations will not function with legacy sub-classes. Compatibility may be added for legacy subclasses upon request.
- If you are updating from the D&D 3.x system and encounter problems when trying to medkit update already-automated items, try applying automations to fresh (non-automated) items instead and see if the problems persist.
- Please report any found bugs on the CPR Discord server or make a Github issue.

The old features may not medkit correctly into the new ones. Adding them manually from the CPR compendium or using the medkit on a previously non-medkit feature will fix this.

# 1.1.0 Release:
## New Content:
- 2024 Weapon Masteries
## Updated Content:
- Globe of Invulnerability
## Update Notes:
- This is the first beta release for dnd5e 4.x. Expect some bugs, both on CPR's side and Midi's side
- CPR has changed to make use of Activities whenever possible, in many cases obsoleting the need for synthetic item uses. As such, there are some changes (most non-player-facing):
    - Certain spells/features (such as Bestow Curse) now have activities for each possible variation of them
    - Temporarily-available features (such as the "Move" functionality of the Dawn spell) are configured as activities on the parent item when possible. These will be dynamically unhidden when necessary (and added to "favorites" when done)
    - Items which were previously used entirely synthetically (like Scorching Ray's "Bolt" spell feature) are now also configured as activities on the parent item. These will always remain hidden
    - Regarding "hidden" activities: They will be visible on the item sheet. This means they can be _modified_ if desired (for example, changing the formula or damage type for Magic Missile bolts). This also means however that if they are _deleted_ from the sheet, automations which expect them to exist will fail. Unless you know what you're doing, never _delete_ any activities from a medkitted item
- With the exception of the new weapon masteries, CPR has not yet implemented any content from the 2024 rulebooks. Nevertheless, in preparation for doing so, the 2014-specific content compendiums have been moved into a "2014" subfolder

# Cauldron of Plentiful Resources 1.0.0 Release!
Cauldron of Plentiful Resources (Chris's Premades) has finally reached full v12 compatibility, and it's 1.0.0 release!
### *Why the name change?*
Chris started the module Chris's Premades to more easily share macros he had made, but the project has expanded since, and the module has multiple authors now, Autumn and, most recently, Michael. Michael has done a *huge* amount of work to help get Cauldron of Plentiful Resources to v12, and has improved and expanded many features.
### *What took so long???*
For the switch the v12, we decided to do a near-complete re-write of the module. Our best practices have changed and we've learned a lot in a year-and-a-half since the module was first published. This doesn't mean too much from the user's perspective, but on the back end, the code runs differently and is much cleaner.
## Notes for migration
***Any items from v11 Chris's Premades will not work in 1.0.0 of Cauldron of Plentiful Resources***. We recommend starting with fresh actors/items on v12 if you're migrating your world. Medkitting old items may have mixed results. ***Any customized macros from v11 will also not work***. All helpers have changed slightly. There is documentation on this in the Cauldron of Plentiful Resources discord server.
